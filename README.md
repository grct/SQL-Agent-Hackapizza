# SQL Agent - Hackapizza
SQL-Agent-Hackapizza is a project developed during IBM & Datapizza's Hackathon in January 2025, an event focused on Generative AI. The project aims to create an AI agent capable of interacting with SQL databases to manage and optimize recipes in a multi-dimensional culinary universe.

This project utilizes **LangGraph** for orchestrating agents and **Vanna AI** for generating SQL queries through LLMs. The core AI model used is **Mistral Large**, accessed via IBM's **WatsonX** platform.
